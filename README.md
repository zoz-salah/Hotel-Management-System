# Hotel Management System (Python)

## Overview
This project is a **console-based Hotel Management System** implemented in Python using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).  
It allows hotel staff to manage rooms, bookings, and checkouts efficiently through a simple menu-driven interface.

The project is designed for educational purposes to practice:
- Classes and objects
- Encapsulation
- Lists as dynamic storage
- Basic system design

## Features
- Add new hotel rooms
- Book a room for a guest
- Checkout a guest from a room
